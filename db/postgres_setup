Cygwin 
	Read Cygwin/postgres README!
	Packages
		ash, bash, cygwin, cygrunsvr, fileutils, grep, ncurses,
		postgresqlreadline, sed, sh-utils and textutils.  + cygipc (part of
		Cygwin Utilities)

	Setup: Manual Start Method
		Run "ipc-daemon &".
		Once ipc-daemon is running, initialize a database directory with
			initdb -D /cygdrive/d/apps/cygwin/usr/local/pgsql/data 
		Start postmaster:
			postmaster -i -D /cygdrive/d/apps/cygwin/usr/local/pgsql/data
			Run this in own window without a '&' to see messages.

		Setup: NT Service Method
			Read /usr/doc/cygwin/postgresql README for instructions.

		Set up account to run postmaster:
			"login incorrect".: You cannot change user context on NT/W2K if
			your account has not explicitely set several user rights. Even
			administrator doesn't have all these user rights. These rights are
			"Act as part of the operating system" "Replace process level token"
			"Increase quotas"

		Probably use SYSTEM account as is default for services.

		Install postgres as service with cygrunsrv (see example under notes for
		ssh).  ipc-daemon - install & run as a service w/o cygrunsrv (contains
		own code for this)
