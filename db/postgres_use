psql
	which user to run as
		sudo su - postgres
		or createuser and run as that, either by being logged in as that user
		or with -U option, or set PGUSER

	\' commands
		l       list databases
		c       change to a new db

Table design
    Timestamp:      colname TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()

Serial Type
	Used to create unique identifiers for table entries

	  CREATE TABLE mytable (
		 myid    SERIAL  PRIMARY KEY,
		 ...
	  )

	then:
		INSERT INTO mytable (col1, col2,...) VALUES (value1, value2,...)
	
	If update as above, Serial value created automatically (per README.Debian)

Datatypes
	boolean, bool - value may be unquoted true/false
	character(n), char(n) - fixed length string, padded with spaces
	character varying(n), varchar(n) - string up to length n
	text - variable length string, unlimited length (PG specific but found in some other db's) 
	integer, int - signed, 4 byte number
	float (8 bytes), real (4 bytes) - floating point integers
	numeric/decimal(precision,scale) - precision is to left of decimal point, scale to right
	serial - auto-incrementing number (PG specific)
	date, time, time (with tz), timestamp, interval

	NULL - no value set
	values - enclose in single quotes (incl. numbers)
