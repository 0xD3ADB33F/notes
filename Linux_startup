STARTUP NOTES

lilo
	lilo.conf 
	boot -	name of device where installing lilo.  If on a partition,
	lilo is installed as a secondary boot loader. (always for Debian).


kernel boot

/sbin/init	
	Init is run as last step following kernel boot.  Is usually in
	/sbin/init.  Can run manually to debug.  Optionally give runlevel as
	argument.

	When run, first looks for its configuration file /etc/inittab, and in
	inittab looks for an entry of type initdefault.  

Runlevels
	Software configurations which allow only specified processes to exist.

	Runlevels are 0-6 plus s or S which is used mainly by scripts run when
	entering single user mode (runlevel 1) Runlevel s invokes /bin/sulogin
	on /dev/console.
	
	Runlevel switching (including startup & shutdown) runs all the scripts
	(which are really links to the scripts in /etc/init.d) in the directory
	in /etc/rd.d that is being exited beginning with K in the order that
	they appear in a directory listing.  The same thing is done for a run
	level being entered except that the scripts executed start with a S.

/etc/inittab
	Used by System V compatible init process.

	Takes #s 0-6 as arg for each runlevel.  Init program runs statements
	in /etc/inittab. Default runnlevel specified in line starting with
	'id'.  See man inittab for format of entries.  Wait entry requires
	completion of all scripts in rc.d before continuing.
	
	RH: runs /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit and the scripts in rc.d corresponding to
	the runlevel.  Boot scripts are in /etc/init.d/.  Configuration data is in
	files in /etc/sysconfig. 

	Debian: runs /etc/init.d/rcS and then /etc/init.d/rc [runlevel]. rc
	is the runlevel changer and also starts and stops services.
	Script links are in /etc/rc?.d (ie directories in the root of /etc) but
	real files are back in /etc/init.d/.  Each of the scripts in /init.d/
	must accept the args start, stop, restart, reload, and force-reload.
	Reload reloads the configuration w/o stoping the service.


	Starts the login routine. 

NETWORK SERVICES CONTROL

Inetd & Inetd.conf
	Control which services runs
	Restart all services (eg after a change) with either of:
		indetd restart
		killall _HUP inetd
