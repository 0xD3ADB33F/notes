Determine a window name and class
    xprop | grep WM_CLASS

then apply resource properties as 
name[.*]Class.prop: value

###########
To set sizes of individual windows: set the following X resources

    Netscape*Navigator.geometry: WxH+X+Y      for the browser windows
    Netscape*Mail.geometry: WxH+X+Y           for the mail window
    Netscape*News.geometry: WxH+X+Y           for the news window
    Netscape*Bookmark.geometry: WxH+X+Y       for the bookmark window
    Netscape*AddressBook.geometry: WxH+X+Y    for the addressbook window
    Netscape*Composition.geometry: WxH+X+Y    for the composition window

    Netscape*TopLevelShell.geometry: WxH+X+Y  sets all of the above windows
    to be the same size.

    The -geometry command line option sets the sizes of just the
browser, mail and news windows.

You should set these defaults in .Xdefaults.
Then use /usr/bin/X11/xrdb -load ~/.Xdefaults to load them without logging out.
