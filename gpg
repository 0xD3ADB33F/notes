Encrypt a document
	conventional or symetric, w/o public key
		gpg -c <filename>
	for specific user
		gpg --output doc.gpg --encrypt --recipient name@dom.com doc
	Tar & encrypt
		tar -c /var /etc | gpg -r EEC775E3 -e -o /tmp/backup.tar.gpg
Decrypt a document
	gpg <filename>
	needed: private key to which doc was encrypted
		gpg --output doc --decypt doc.gpg

Sign documents
	gpg --output doc.sig --sign doc   #doc is compressed and signed
	gpg --output doc.sig --detach-sig doc  #detached compressed signuture file created.
	gpg --clearsign doc #clearsigned - creates doc.asc in two part body + signature format
	
Verifying signatures - validates the origin and verifies the integrity of document
Verify a detached signature
	gpgv file.sig
		prints ID of signing key and attempts to check
		against key in keyring.
		If key not available, retreive from keyserver:
	gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 621CC013
		now gpgv will verify that pubkey in chain signed this file
		To verify that this key is genuine, check user home page or search web for key and name to find matches or see if signed by known good signatures.

Manage keys in keychain
	Master key is for creating signatures and collects signatures of others who have confirmed my identity.  
	gpg --edit-key name
	uid <name>
		select a uid for editing
		> sign
		> check

Key types (left column in --edit-key display)
    pub     Public Master signing key
    sub     Public subordinate key
    sec     Private master private key
    sbb     Private subordinate key

    May add multiple User IDs for signing.
    Change subordinate keys (used to do encryptions) occasionally - if broken, all data encrypted with it is exposed and key must be revoked.  Avoid changing public master since this is how key is identified. 

    Certificate - a pub key signed to verify origin and defeat tampering
        Subkeys and User IDs automatically signed

    Validating other keys



#Multiple file input.  GPG compresses it's input:
tar -c comNotes | gpg -ear douggorley > comNotes.tar.gz.asc

Create message without saving to file (end with C-d)
gpg --output encrypted_file -e -r User
