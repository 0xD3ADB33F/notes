User Access
	login restrictions
		in /etc/pam.d/
			su 
				Only members of wheel can su to root:
				auth required pam_wheel.so group=wheel debug 
				
		file permissions
			umask
				examples
					022 - default (files are 644, dirs 751).  
					027 - group can list & read files, no access for others
				Set in PAM login.def and later in /etc/profile/, /etc/zshrc, or 
				in user configs, and also via adduser from settings in /etc/skel/.
            Leave user group name 'username' - this prevents group access 
                to personal info (eg by adding to a 'user' group).
            Set DIR_MODE in /etc/adduser.conf to 0750 to remove default 
				world-readable 0755.  If a web server should read 
				~/public_html 
				for personal web page sharing, change DIR_MODE to 0751.
		ssh
			keychain 
				add to .zlogin:
					keychain ~/.ssh/id_dsa
					. ~/.keychain/<hostname>-sh				  	

					

		gpg -  protect memory of program from being read
			chown root /usr/bin/gpg
			chmod u+s /usr/bin/gpg

Groups
	adm
		reads logs
	staff
		junior admins
		could give access to /usr/local


firewall policies (from Securing Debian)
	* incoming connections are allowed only to local services by allowed machines.
	* outgoing connections are only allowed to services used by your system (DNS, web browsing, pop, email....) [33]
	* the forward rule denies everything (unless you are protecting other systems, see below).
	* all other incoming or outgoing connections are denied.

	ports to open
		80, 443 (secure web, imap etc.)

Network Security
    Port scanning
        nmap <IP address pattern>
			check open ports
				nmap -sT -PT your.external.ip.address	
			what program listening on port?
				lsof -i tcp:<port>
	Disabling daemons
		remove links in /etc/rc.d and scripts in /etc/init.d
	inetd
		not much used here
		uncomment services in inetd.conf or update-inetd
		inetd vulnerable to DOS - consider xinetd instead
	tripwire
		policies - twpol.txt
			determine which directories to snapshot and rules for identifying
			violations
		tripwire
			--init	create snapshot
			--check 
		edit config and policies
			generate config files
				twadmin --print-cfgfile > twcfg.txt
				twadmin --print-polfile > twpol.txt
		edit, and resign pol and cfg
			twadmin --create-cfgfile --cfgfile /etc/tripwire/tw.cfg \ 
			  --site-keyfile site_key etc/tripwire/twcfg.txt
			twadmin --create-polfile --cfgfile /etc/tripwire/tw.cfg \
			  --site-keyfile /etc/tripwire/site_key /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt
