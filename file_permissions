		permissions for shared directories
			http://helpdesk.ua.edu/unix/tipsheet/tipv3n7.html

Stickiness
	Files 
		executable & sharable file which is not immediately discarded from swap 
			after execution.  Only root can create.
	Directories "+t"
		only file owner and write or delete
		used in common directories when write access granted thr. group

setuid & setguid
	Files
		setuid	
			Set-user-on-execution bits
			eg chmod +s ...  => -rwsr-xr-x
	Directory "g+s"
		setguid	
			all files created in dir have group of dir
				1. change dir ownership to group
				2. set group write permissions on dir
				3. chmod g+s or leading 2, chmod 2xxx
			file moved in not affected, files copied are
    
Permissions 
File Permissions
    r 4  read
    w 2  write
    x 1  execute
	X	execute only if a dir or already executable
    t   executable and sticky
    T   sticky but not executable
    s   setuid or setguid and executable
    S   setuid or setguid but not executable

Directory Permissions
    r	show files in directory listing
    w	change directory contents
    x	access by name (executable, as in access with a program)
		this permission sufficient to 'see through' if path known
    t   sticky
    s   setuid and guid

Modes are absolute (using octal numbering) or symbolic

File Mode Octal Examples 
	600		personal
	644, 664	readonly for group or world

Directory Octal Mode Examples
	700		personal
	750		group read
	775		group access, world read
	701		others can execute dirs but not read in them, 
			ie could do a listing further in
			- this might be for a personal dir with a public_html subdir

Special modes
    4000    set user ID on execution
    2000    set group ID on execution
    1000    sticky bit


who=perm
    =rw,+X  set rw to defaults, retain ex that are already set
    u=rwx,go=rx (755) file is rx by everyone, w by owner only
    go= clear all modes for go
    g=u,u-w set group bits equal to user bits but clear g write bit

umask	restricts access - subtracted from default mode
