Mail Message Format	
Received Header:
	Received: from <domain of sending mailserver> (<reverse DNS checked name>[sending host IP])
		'from' hostname part is passed in SMTP HELO command and could be forged
		by receiving host[s].  However if receiving server does a reverse DNS check, the header will show:

	Received: from <name1> (<name2> [IP])

		via physical path
		with link/mail protocol
		id receiver message-id
	Return-path Header
		Return-path: route-addr
			lists full path of message.  This field added by final server
	Originator Header
		Reply-To: address
	Authentic Header
		From: user-name
		Sender: usern-name (usually same as From)
	Date Header
	Desination Header
		To: address
			informational only - recipient specified by RCPT command
	Messages are delimited by the word "From" or ">From" (usually followed by 
	sender name & receipt date).  RFC822 headers follow the From line.
