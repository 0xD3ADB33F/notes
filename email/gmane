Explanatory message after subscribing:


This list can now be read on gmane.org under the name: gmane.linux.debian.devel.nonprofit

For those who haven't yet discovered gmane, it's a mail to news gateway, meaning that it allows you to read and post to mailing lists in your newsreader instead by way of subscribing.  This greatly simplifies following numerous lists - messages aren't piling up in your IMAP folders, for one thing, no more keeping track of how to unsubscribe from lists, for another.

You can read lists in a browser on the site, but only the last 600 messages are available this way.  Full archives are avaiable via nntp.

To prevent email address harvesting, addresses can optionally be mangled.  This feature is called address encryption and is enabled for this list.
