Definitions
	SmartHost
		a machine that gets _all_ mail that is sent by the machine, allowing
		the machine in question to be firewalled away so that only the
		smarthost is reachable by SMTP.
 
		 The purpose of using a smarthost is (a) minimizing the need for DNS on
		 the original machine, and (b) allowing it to be firewalled away.
 
Delivery
	Default mail delivery location:  new mail goes to 'home_mailbox', default
	is ~/.maildir - ie directly to user directories and not to /var/.  Mutt
	will make this if doesn't exist or use Courier-IMAP makemaildir tool.

Testing setup:
	set soft_bounce=yes while testing
	mutt -x root etc.   
		-x emulates console 'mail' 
		check local delivery, accept prompt to create .maildir
	grep logs on queue ID to trace path
	debug sessions with particular domains
		debug_peer_list=<domain list>
		debug_peer_level=2	

setup utilities
    dpkg-reconfigure Postfix

	postalias <alias text file>
		rebuild binary alias db	
		-q pat alias_file	
			query alias table, print first entry matching pat
	postfix 
		reload - seems to be cause changes to be recognized even where restart doesn't
		start,stop
		check
	postconf	display and edit main.cf
		-m		check what support is compiled in
		-n		show non-default config values
	mailq	
		check mail queue
	newaliases 
		run after editing aliases (or other hash files?)
	logs
		egrep '(reject|warning|error|fatal|panic):' /var/log/mail.*

Config
	myhostname	
		usually would specify the FQN of mail server
		defaults to system hostname as shown by 'uname -n'
		is default address of all local users
		This is the hostname as it appears in 'Received: from <hostname>'
		part of the header of sent messages
	mydomain 
		derived from $myhostname
		set this if mail server receives mail for whole domain
		if myorigin set by /etc/mailname, what to do with this?
	myorigin 
		The FQN that is appended to local addresses (ie user name only)
		defaults to myhostname, but can be set to = $mydomain.  If this is 
		done, an MX record must be specified.
		Debian: can set to read /etc/mailname (or is default?)
		External SMTP servers will reject mail if myorigin not valid domain
	mydestination
		list of domains this system considers local
		default is $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain
	mynetworks_style
		not used if mynetworks is defined
		= class | subnet | host 
			host means trust localhost only
	mynetworks
		ipaddresses/netmak list
		file
	relay_domains
		don't need to change this from default unless server is a backup 
		server for domains
	inet_interfaces
		interfaces mail received on

Routing
	if message matches
		mydestination - delivery = local
		virtual mailbox domains = virtual
		$relay_domains = relay (clone of smtp)
		none = smtp


Address rewriting
	preliminary rewriting
		user -> user@$myorigin
		user@host -> user@host.$mydomain
	virtual domains
		each domain has own namespace - local names not visible
		virtual_maps - list of virtual mapping tables

Forwarding for unknown recipients with luser_relay
	sysadmin+$user

User databases
	aliases - used by Postfix local delivery process
		default is /etc/aliases
		format 
			name: val1, val2
			name is a local address (no domain part)
			value is any of:
				email adress
				!command
				/file/name - see man page for these 2
		address extension supported (e.g. user+foo) - search done on unextended
		address (user).
	virtual domains
		edit /etc/postfix/virtual
			domain -
			user@domain  user@otherdomain
			@domain  @otherdomain
		run
			postmap /etc/postfix/virtual

	MySQL
		need compiled in support and debian postfix-mysql
