DNS
	Email server must know how to use DNS to find a server responsible for 
	receiving email for the destination domain. Does this by first locating a 
	DNS server for the domain and querying it for the domain's MX record.  Can 
	then start a SMTP session with that server to send mail.

    Use host or dig to manually verify a domain's MX record.

	Mail server record should point to a hostname defined by an 'A' record.  
	Hostnames defined as CNAMEs may not work with all MTA programs.
