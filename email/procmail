
Local Delivery Agent (LDA).  Program used by mail
server to deliver mail to mailboxes of user.
Examples: procmail, sendmail(?), tmail, dmail, deliver.


PROCMAIL

Create .procmailrc file and remove 'w' permission for g & o.
Home dir sometimes must be world-searchable ('x').
If .forward file is used, chmod 644.
Create a Procmail dir to hold recipies.

Example .procmailrc:


  # Set to yes when debugging
  VERBOSE=no
  
  # Remove ## when debugging; set to no if you want minimal logging
  ## LOGABSTRACT=all 
  
  # Replace $HOME/Msgs with your message directory
  # Mutt and elm use $HOME/Mail
  # Pine uses $HOME/mail
  # Netscape Messenger uses $HOME/nsmail
  # Some news clients, such as slrn & nn, use $HOME/News
  MAILDIR=$HOME/Msgs       # Make sure this directory exists!
   
  # Directory for storing procmail-related files
  PMDIR=$HOME/Procmail
  
  # Put ## before LOGFILE if you want no logging (not recommended)
  LOGFILE=$PMDIR/log
  INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/testing.rc
  INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/lists.rc
