cd to dir with one word different in path (two variations):
    cd <old> <new>
    cd ${PWD/3.4/2.7}

Configuration {{{1
Startup Files {{{2
	zprofile: 
		only run by login shells (called with -l) or su -.  Use for env vars used by
		applications, e.g. MAI
	zshenv: 
		only startup that is always run.  Best place for environment
	variables
	zshrc

CD stack
	cp file ~1 - copy file to first dir in stack 


Parameters {{{1  

set by:
    parameter_name=value - No space before or after '='
    Get value (parameter expansion) with $parameter_name

expansion  - see zshparam


Expansions {{{1

Ctrl+/ to undo an expansion

parameter expansion
    $ character introduces parameter/brace expansion
    ${name} - braces are optional

event selection:
	!           start history expansion
	!!			last command - may omit ! if followed by :<word selection>
    !^          first param
    !:2         second param
    !*          all previous args
	!str        last command starting with str
	!?str[?]    last command containing str

word selection: 
    number	- 0 is cmd
    * - all args
    $ - last arg
    x-  Arguments from #x to $ (last arg)
        ex. !!0-  Command + all args except last 



modifiers {{{1

syntax :+letter 
same for globbing and parameter substitution 

usage: 
    history events - word:modifier (same as bash)
    parameter substitution - ${param:<mod>}
    globbing - *(:t)  
        may combine with qualifier (U:t)
        e.g. cd to directory of last path argument
            cd !$:h 
flags:
    h  head (dirname)
    t  tail - filename w/o path
    r  rest (extension removed) 
    e  extension
    l/u - convert letters to lower/upper case
    s   substitute :s/old/new

Globbing {{{1

http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Intro/intro_2.html

set all subdirs group writable & setgid
	chmod g+ws **/*(/)
	 zargs **/*(/) -- chmod -R 750 (avoids too long argument error, requires autoload zargs)

read: http://zsh.sunsite.dk/Guide/zshguide05.html#l137

*    matches string of zero or more characters
?    any one character
**/<pat> - recursive globbing
	matches <pat> anywhere in path including in top directory

operators {{{2

alternatives
    (alt1|alt2)
        no dir / allowed in pat
        (alt1|) alt1 or nothing
negation
    ^<pat>  - matches anything but pat
        negated part extends to end of string or ) but not past /
        **/^pat/tmp	- echo dir names having a tmp subdir
    x~y - match x unless also matches y
        grep thing *~*html(.)


Qualifiers {{{2 

select files & directories by time, size, type, ownership, permissions
syntax: <pat>(qualifier)
file types
    .	files
    /	dirs
    *	exec
    %	slinks
permissions:
    by ownership (u:<owner>)
        *(u0) - owned by root
        *(u:andmalc:) - owned by me
        *(^u:andmalc:) - no owned by me
    by file spec: (f:<spec>:)
        print **/*(f:o+r:) - print files that are other readable - 
        print *(f:gu+w,o-rx:) - files are writeable by owner ('user') and neither readable nor executable by other.
        print *(f700)
    permission shortforms
        f# or f=#	files with access rights = #
        (r), (w) and (x) readable, writeable and executable by the owner
        (R), (W) and (X) as above, for world permissions
        (A), (I) and (E) as above,  for group permissions
        s	setuid files (04000)
        S	setgid files (02000)
        t   files with the sticky bit (01000)
timestamp 
    type
        a		access
        m		change/modified
    time
        s	second
        h	hour
        day 	(default - no modifier needed)
        week	w
        month	M
    examples
        **/*(.*m-1)  files and scripts with mod times of one day or less
        mw-1 modified within last week
        mw1 Modified more than one week but less than 2 weeks
        mw+1 modified more than one week ago
        *(amh-5) - accessed within the last 5 hours
        cm-5 - changed in last five minutes
        (mM+36) modified more than 3 years ago

	size
		L i.e. length qualifier
			(L[km][+-]<size>)
			*(Lk+10) - larger than 10k
	combining qualifiers
		files are owned by me and less than 5k or not world writable
			*(ULk-5,^W) 

flags {{{2

(#i) - case insensitive matching within pattern
    in effect until end of pattern or as delimited by ()
    WoRDs = Wo((#i)rd)s

Arrays  {{{1
	Multiple 'word' parameters.  
	spaces separate words
	arrayname=(wordone wordtwo)
		$#array   get array size
		$array[n] get index
		$array[5,8] get slice
	Make list from directory listing:
		list=(/usr/bin/*)
		list=(/usr/bin/*:
	Multiple word 'words': when expanded, e.g
		a=('first word' 'second word')
		cmd $a[0]
		cmd wllget single argument 'first word' - not true in other shells.
	Array Bound (Tied) variables - for making PATH type variables: 
		typeset -TU	<SCALER> <array-name>
		upper case form is for exporting to environment, lower case form is
		easier to manipulate in shell.
		U option ensures unique - not adding if already set
			typeset -TU PYTHONPATH pythonpath
			pythonpath=(/lib/python/site-packages lib/python2.2/site-packages)
			
            typeset -U PATH path
            path+=(blah/blah) #appends 
            path=(~/foo "$path[@]") #foo at beginning of array

	eg
		${array:gs/foo/bar} substitute foo for bar throughout array
		${list:#pat} list excluding pat
		$var:t  tail of path

Processes {{{1
	Process substitution
		( )		makes file
		<( )	makes fifo

Programming {{{1 

Loops {{{2

for file in `ls -lh` ; do
    echo $file
done

for file in **/*(.); do mv $file{,.sh}; done

Delete zero length files
ls -l  **/*(L0) | while read file; do
    rm $file;
done


Startup Files {{{1
	zprofile: 
		only run by login shells (called with -l) or su -.  Use for env vars used by
		applications, e.g. MAI
	zshenv: 
		only startup that is always run.  Best place for environment
	variables
	zshrc
	zlogin: 
		runs after zshrc.  Purpose really just equivalent of Bourne-type
		shells /etc/profile and csh login (?).

Dynamic Prompt {{{1

autoload -U promptinit
promptinit
prompt bart

The print builtin works like echo, but gives us access to the % prompt escapes.
print -Pn ...   print, performing Prompt expansion & dont print newline

precmd ()   a function which is executed just before each prompt
chpwd ()    a function which is executed whenever the directory is changed
	Using chpwd() instead of precmd(). See zshmisc man page
preexec ()  
	executed just after command read and about to be executed.
	Arguments to preexec ($*, $1,$2,$3) are forms of cmd.

set xterm title to "username@hostname: directory":
	case $TERM in
		xterm*)
			precmd () {print -Pn "\e]0n@%m: %~\a"}
			;
	esac

Good one: From http://www.princeton.edu/~kmccarty/zsh.html 
	case $TERM in (xterm*|rxvt)
		precmd () { print -Pn "\e]0;%n@%m: %~\a" }
		preexec () { print -Pn "\e]0;%n@%m: $1\a" }
		;;
	esac
