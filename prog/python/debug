import pdb; pdb.set_trace();

* Other libraries
ipdb
pdbpp (pip install)

* Manual setup with no import
try:
    line_that_causes_exception()
except:
    while True:
        exec(raw_input('>>> '))


* No change to source:
Create a file named .pdbrc (leading period) and enter this into it:

break awesome.py:15

Then run this:

python -m pdb awesome.py #this will launch the debugger

Even more useful, assuming you only want to break under certain conditions, you can add a statement that evaluates to a boolean:

break awesome.py:15, x < 5
