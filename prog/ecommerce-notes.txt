I gather that you're in england, so I can't really answer your
question with specifics, but way over here in canada :) we have a
couple of options. Our website uses 2 main methods to calculate
shipping... With Fedex, our customers input their postal/zip code
prior to finalizing their order. When it comes time to calculate the
shipping, our website sends this info to a fedex webserver and it
calculates the rate in real time, and returns it. This allows us to
charge the actual shipping rate, rather than a guestimate. The point
of this example is that you should contact the major local shipping
companies (unfortunately, i'm not familiar with carriers in your neck
of the woods) and see what they have to offer in that area. Also,
troll around http://www.oscommerce.com/community.php and see what they
have to say. there's quite a large international community there, and
they might have something specific to your needs that you could
incorportate.

The other method we use is greyhound. This was a bugger to do, but we
actually manually typed in all the locations and zones that we could
ship to, and the actual rate that it would cost to ship to each zone.
Heck of a lot of typing, but it's well worth it when all is said and
done.
