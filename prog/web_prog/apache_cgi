CGI
====
Budget method:
        ExecCGI option set for script directories or locate script 
    in a ScriptAlias'ed directory.
    Rename python scripts *.cgi and add python-schebang line.

    
Still Basic method:
        ExecCGI option set for script directories or locate script 
    in a ScriptAlias'ed directory.
    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .py .pyc .pyo  - or
        On Windows, change ScriptInterpreterSource to 'registry'

Fancy method:
    Obtain handler module (or use Action directive), load with LoadModule
        Create new AddHandler directive for file extention or SetHandler for
    a directory/directory tree.


Mistake: ScriptAlias entry must map to directory path ending in a '/'.

Handlers can either be built into the server or included in a module, or they can be added with the Action directive.

AddHandler Directive
---------------------

AddHandler maps the filename extensions extension to the handler handler-name. This mapping is added to any already in force, overriding any mappings that already exist for the same extension. For example, to activate CGI scripts with the file extension ".cgi", you might use: 

    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

SetHandler Directive
--------------------

As for AddHandler, for all files within scope of directive.

Security
-----------
... just like mod_perl and mod_php, mod_snake and mod_python both embed
Python into Apache, and so it runs under the permissions of the Apache
server, not as a separate user like 'suexec'.

But note that you don't need mod_python or mod_snake to run Python scripts
at all. They're just handy speedups and provide hooks into Apache,
and some forms of persistance and such.

If you want to have fast CGI's, persistance *and* run them as another user,
you should consider FastCGI instead.
