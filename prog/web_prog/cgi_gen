What is a CGI Script?

Example of a script:
	#!/bin/sh

	echo Content-type: text/plain
	echo


Output Header
	Content-type (output header) line 
		informs the browser whether the text can be displayed or whether an
		exernal viewer must be invoked.  This line (as a header) is not
		content: it is not displayed.  It is separated from the body by a blank
		line.

	Common formats and content-types:
		HTML		text/html
		text		text/plain
		gif			image/gif	etc.

Invoking Scripts with Arguments
	Specify args in the invoking URL.  
		A '?' starts the arg list, with '+' separating each one.  The form of
		arg passing is called a Query.

	Link with arg:
	<a href="http://www.thing.com/cgi-bin/genericq?john">Is John There?</a>

RefeREncing arg in script:
echo --content header--

echo --some html---
if [! -z "$john" ]; then
	echo "<p>$john is here"
else
	echo "<p>$john isn't here"
fi
echo "</body></html>"

HTTP Headers
	Cookie & Authentication often need to be manipulated, often in response to Set-Cookie and WWW-Authenticate headers received from the server

Get requests
	Use URL as a 'command line' to submit requests for a resource plus with arguments

Post requests
	Requests with many arguments may submit args in name/value pairs in message body instead of in URL itself.

html directory is $ENV{'DOCUMENT_ROOT'}/www

cgi-bin directory is $ENV{'DOCUMENT_ROOT'}/cgi-bin
