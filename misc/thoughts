Try now to give up on knowing how to work it out.

The best way to live is just to act.  Last night I was acting under the
influence of being unwell.  I am not really aware of what things make me
act.  I do things impulsively, not after consideration.  I will act
differently only as I begin to feel differently.

My work is now to give up on what I am.  

Not what I am: to believe, to awaken, to have awareness, 


waiting.
