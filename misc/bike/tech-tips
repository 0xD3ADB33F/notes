Geometry & handling {{{1
Types {{{2

Track geometry
	fast but steep angles > harsher ride
	Steep seat tube 
		saddle forward for faster cadence, body is in sprinting position
		not as good for climbing
	head angle, reduced rake fork
		toe overlap OK as bike is moving fast
		quicker response, harser ride
	head tube
		shorter as rider pushing hard on pedals and need little support from bars

Touring
	longer chainstays and slack head and seat tubes better for absorbing bumps but less maneuverable
	frames built with thicker tubes for better lateral stiffness under load
	head angle
		slacker 
		- doesn't dive into corners like a racing bike but maintains straight line stability for longer rides when rider is tired.
		- less chance of toe overlap
	head tube
		longer - reduces weight on hands when rider not always pushing on pedals.

Seat tube angle {{{2
	http://www.billbostoncycles.com/seat_tube_angle.htm
	Slack ST => shorter TT due to lesser forward tilt of  pelvis			
		Also => shorter reach as a lesser proportion of TT is ahead of the BB

Reach {{{2
	the horizontal distance between bb and headtube measured along the toptube
	
	Rivendale: Top tubes of a given length tend to feel shorter on bigger frames than on
smaller ones, so if you currently ride a 56cm bike with a 55cm top tube, but
you know you can fit a 58cm frame, don't be scared off it just because it has a
57cm top tube.

Trail examples

Typical modern
	5-6 cm
	700C wheels, 73 degree head angle, fork has 45mm rake => 59mm trail
	wheel flop when riding no handed below 10 mph, 
	when front load, stable at 15 mph

	Steamroller 59
	MB Phantom Cross 57
	Raleigh One Way 47
	
Randonneur (i.e. sport touring) design: 
	3.5-4.5 cm
	70mm of rake for a trail in the 30s (mm).
	bikes designed for stable handling when touring at speed with some load in front
	w/o front load & at speed will be bit unstable ('shimmy','nervous')

Touring
	Fuji: 5.5-6 rake, head tube angle ~70 = 66 mm trail
	LHT: 4.5 rake, ht 71 = 73 mm trail

Head tube {{{2

Angle
	too much = harder out of seat climbing
	touring bike: shallower, e.g. Sherpa ~71 degrees, Fuji ~70

Length
	Determines (mostly) vertical size of bike
	Long allows long legged rider to raise bars w/o spacers or upward stem
	For 58tt road bike with 7 cm bb drop and ~370 axle to crown fork:
		short <= 17 cm, long = 20-22
	On cross frames, may be 2cm less due to longer fork; also maybe shorter if high bb
	Add 2cm for conventional headsets, none for integrated

BB drop {{{2
	typical modern 70-75mm
	cyclocross 65-70
	touring bike: more for lower BB, e.g. Sherpa 66mm, Fuji 80mm
	
	maybe street fixed is higher?  Raleigh One Way = 55

Chainstay {{{2

Longer
	absorbs bumps as rider is forward of rear wheel instead of over it.
	avoid heelstrike with paniers

Fit {{{1

torso leaning forward
	Advantage
		better use of gluteus muscles
		can pull up with handle bars
		better wind resistance
	Disadvantage
		can lead to arm strain if rider pedels lightly
	

Fore-Aft Saddle Position
	more horizontal torso requires seat further back to maintain balance
	this more important than K.O.P.S.165 (Knee Over Pedal Spindle) 
	Seat back from BB eases rotating hips forward to increase reach

Fore-Aft Tests
	Can remove hands from hoods and hover (also depends on abs strength)
	Weight distribution with low bars: 42-45% on front (less if sitting upright)

TT Length & Seat Tube angle
	http://www.sheldonbrown.com/frame-sizing.html
	1 degree less of angle = 1 cm more of TT


Saddle Discomfort
	http://www.sheldonbrown.com/saddles.html

Wrist pain
	http://www.sheldonbrown.com/frame-sizing.html under Saddle Front/Back Positioning

Saddle height
	often too low for growing children  
	little lower for off-road and clipless pedels

swept-back handlebar
	Drop to swept-back handlebar conversions
		Recommended - long stem (120-130) with rise for semi-performance position
		http://www.bikecommuters.com/2008/01/18/reverse-fixed-gear-conversion

	Handle Bar position
		As the bar gets higher, it also retreats toward you. How much? On a bike
	with a 73.5-degree head tube, raising it 4cm brings it back 1.5cm.

Handlebars & stems {{{1

Handlebar clamp diameter
	25.4 mm, 1" - ISO standard, MTB, Japanese road bars
	26 mm	- road bars
	31.8, 1.25" - new oversize.  Only clamp area is bigger so brake levers not affected

Handlebar non-clamp diameter
	22.2, 7/8" - MTB, hybrid
	23.8, 15/16" - road

Stems
	threadless can fit 25.4 or 26 but quill stems must be matched exactly
	OS stems can take smaller HB sizes with shims

	risk of shorter stems i.e. < 8cm - squirrely handing which can be
	dangerous, such as excessive turning when looking backwards

Brakes {{{1

Disk
	Disc brakes usually require V brake levers
	Planet Bike Cascadia 29er fenders have standoffs for disk mounts

reach:
	Short-reach brakes are the modern standard: 39-50mm brake pad positioning from center of the frame mounting bolt to center of the pad bolt
	Standard-reach brakes are often called “long reach”: 47-57mm brake pad positioning from center of the frame mounting bolt to center of the pad bolt. Back in the day, just about everything was this size. We still use it on our road frames because we like to have extra clearance for big cushy tires
	Longer for smaller wheels on regular frames, e.g. 67mm for 650B wheels

Compare:
	Caliper
		easier to mount with racks, fenders
		work with STI
	
	Canti
		easier to mount with racks, fenders
		work with STI
		wider  clearance than Vbrake for mud & snow
		slighly lighter than Vbrakes
		harder to adjust
		Said better stopping power with Vbrake pads (Avid Shorty and Kool Stop v type pads)


	Vbrake
		easier cable routing 

	mini-V brake
		use drop hb levers
		may not fit over large fenders
		may need barrel adjuster to remove wheel with large tires

Wheels,  Tires, & Hubs {{{1

Wheel design {{{2

V-section rim vs. Box shape rim
	strong & rigid
	aerodynamic
	more material so heavier
	harsher ride
Wheel Sizes {{{2 
	650b
		650b is neat in that you use a smaller diameter rim and a larger
outside diameter tire and end up with a total OD that approximates 700c/25 mm
tire. There's no magic in 650b, and frankly, if the manufacturers would put out
a lightweight and high quality road tire in 26" I'm sure that would work just
as well. And if you have no intention of using a tire larger than 30 mm or so,
I wouldn't bother with 650b. The advantage, as far as I concerned, is the
ability to use unusually wide yet light and very high quality road tires,
without toe overlap or other problems associated with gigantic wheels.

	29er
		Absorb bumps better so suspension may not be needed as for 26"

	630 mm:
		aka 27"
		common until mid-80's
	622 mm: 
		aka 700C (french system referring to OD of wheel + letter designation of width)
		also aka 29" when knobby tire mounted i.e. 29er
	559 mm:
		MTB, comfort, cruiser size
		Harsh ride when used with narrow tires

	584 mm or '650B'
		traditional on French loading touring bikes & tandems
		avoids toe clip overlap
		may allow wider tires on 700C size frames 
		rims are typically wider
		easier mounting for short riders
		more comfortable ride on bad pavement (SB site)
		brake arms need 19mm more reach

Wheel building {{{2

As a tip, when buiding a wheel, thread the nipples on until there is 1 or 2 threads showing on each spoke. Then tighten each nipple 1/2 turn untill all the spokes have a bit of tension. At that point start working on trueness and roundness. Loose spokes are easier to work than tighter ones. Once the wheel is pretty true/round, tighten all spokes 1/2 turn. Retrue/round the wheel. Repeat until all spokes are pretty snug. Then go in 1/4 turn increments until spokes are up to tension. Retrue the wheel after 50-100 miles of riding.
Tires {{{2

smooth tires corner better on both wet and dry pavement. 

Tread patterns have no effect on surfaces in which they leave no
impression.  That is to say, if the road is harder than the tire, a
tread pattern does not improve traction.


Sheldon Brown - match tire & wheel widths

Rivendale tire width & presssure guide:
	http://www.rivbike.com/assets/full/0000/0006/rivbike_pick_a_tire.pdf
	Little reason to use < 32 mm: comfort, fewer flats, better traction

	Light rider:
		paved: 28-32 65-80 psi
		unpaved: 35-37 40-55 psi


Winter tires {{{3

Get tires with studs on sides as well as in centre like Nokian 240's for rutted snow
If road is plowed regularly, no ruts so studs in centre only good enough

Hubs {{{2

Rear hubs
	Threaded freewheel - traditional
	Freehub - new style

	spacing
		Road - 130 mm
		MTB - 135 mm
		Track - 110-120 mm

135mm steel road frames:
	A Surly 1x1 and LHT. . the Travelers Check and Cross-check are 132.5.
	Any of the Rivendell road frames... Bombadil, Atlantis, Homer, Hillborne, Betty Foy etc.
	Salsa La Cruz
	Kogswell P/R
	Gunnar Grand Tour and Fastlane
	Soma has a DoubleCross, 132.5
	Vassago Fistacuff
	Pake c'muter
	Steelwool


Derailleur vs. Internal Hub Gearing (IGH)
	IGH benefits:
		robust - no hanging parts to get bent
		gears not exposed to weather
		chain does not move so may enclose
		rear wheel not dished so stronger
		drop-outs & wheels compatible with fixed/single conversion
	IGH drawbacks:
		few shifter options with drop bar handlebars
		less efficient
		expensive
		harder to remove wheel 

IGH hubs:
	Shimano spacing is 132.5 and compat with either road or mtb frames

Recommendations
	8R36 Nexus and Alfine 501 hubs said to be better than previous models


Drop-Outs
	Other than SS/FG frames, typically with about 120mm width, horizontal dropouts practically disappeared from bikes for close to 20 years. Virtually all bikes from about 1990 or so on, except some classic Italian steel frames, had vertical dropouts until quite recently when semi horizontal dropouts started making a comeback on a few bikes and bike frames such as the Surly Crosscheck and Salsa Casseroll, both steel frames.

Safety {{{1

Lights
	mount low so potholes will be more visible and no shadow from tire
	best place for front light: at front of front rack
	next best: fork crown
	best place for rear lights: seatstay or under chainstay

Reflective Tape
	- white reflects more light
	- 
	Placing reflective tape on the inside of the rims between the spokes
	is a highly effective location for night riding because it is visible
	equally to the front and rear while attracting attention through its
	motion.  It is most effective when applied to less than half the rim
	in a solid block.  Five inter-spoke sections does a good job.

Braking
	- apply 3 x the force to the front brake as to the rear
	- when the rear wheel starts to skid =  max breaking force to both

SS/Fixed Conversion {{{1

Surley blog - Avoid using old multi-speed freewheel hubs for single speed
drivetrains. These put the cog so far inwards you won't be able to achieve good
chainline.

http://www.bikeforums.net/showthread.php?t=357747&highlight=single+speed+conversion

Its complicated. There are two factors, of course, in determining
chainline: where the chainring is in front and where the cog is on the
rear. Those two factors break down into several more factors. On the rear,
you can flip the cog and sometimes move it in or out, or put a spacer
behind the cog. Most importantly, you can move the cog around a lot by
choosing how to respace the rear wheel. On the front, you can put the ring
on the inside or outside of the spider, or use spacers to push it farther
in or out. A different length spindle, or a different crank will also move
the chainline around. Lastly, it used to be the custom to have asymmetrical
spindles (longer on one side than the other), so you can move the line
quite a bit just by flipping it around.

Its complicated, but not hard to mess with most of these factors. Trial and
error is maybe the most efficient way to do it.

Do keep in mind that a new single speed wheel will not solve the problem
for you by itself. They come set up for a chainline that your spindle/crank
cannot achieve without further modification. So, even if you go that route
you will have to mess with some of those factors.

My recommendation is to use the current wheel (I presume it is a
freewheel?) and try to bring the rear out as much as possible by respacing
and redishing. Then hope that you can bring the front in as much as
possible by putting the ring on the inside of the ring and maybe using
spacers on the bolts. You have a good chance of this working without
needing a new BB spindle. You will likely have to do all of this with a
purpose-built single speed wheel anyway, so if the current wheel is in
decent shape, you might just as well use it.
