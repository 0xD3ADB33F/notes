Fit Resources {{{1 

Rivendale site: http://www.rivbike.com/article/bike_fit/choosing_a_frame_size

Said of cross bikes: ST hights may be less due to higher BB's.  Therefore use
TT measurements instead.  TT sizes will be 1-1.5 cm less then on road bikes.
Nashbar site:  To size your X frame measure the effective top tube length of
your favorite road frame, add your stem extension, then subtract 1 cm. This is
the measurement you will need to get to with the X frame plus stem extension.
