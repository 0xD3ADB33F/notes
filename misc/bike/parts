Hubs {{{1

Frame {{{1

Frame spacing
- MTB 135mm
- Road 120-130mm
- Track 110 (older bikes) - 120mm (newer)

Head tube angle
	racing bikes 75 or up
	touring 72-73
	
Chainstay length
- def: distance between center of BB and rear axle
- typical for road bike is 415 mm, 16 1/4"
- shorter 
	advantages: faster acceleration, more areodynamic because wheel is closer to seat stay, tighter cornering 
	disadvantages: harder shifting, less stable & impact absorbing, less room for panniers, fenders
- touring bikes have longest, then MTB, then racing bikes 

Gears & chain {{{1
Chainline
- distance from center line of frame to sproket
- 42mm for track is common, similar for internal gear hub

Warning: many road & touring bikes - gearing too high for average user

road diameter 23.8 mm / 15/16"
smaller 22.2mm / 7/8"

Width
	560mm	Origin8 ProRise - good with for me

Sweep
	10 degree	Origin8 ProRise - slight back sweep that doesn't affect fit
Clamp
	25.4 mm		smaller for straight bars

Moustache
	Use tall stem like Dirtdrop to get higher than seat

Accessories {{{1
Panniers & Racks {{{2
	Large Panniers i
		- chainstay length s/b >= 44cm
		- moving weight back on shorter bike affects handling
	Bikes with front suspension can't use front paniers - use a trailer instead

Bikes types {{{1
Touring {{{2
	Wide gearing ranges, down to 20-25 gear inches for uphill loaded
	Three chainwheels
	Strong forks for front paniers - weaker ones will not be stable
	Tire width: at least 28C but better 32C or 35C 
		(better durability & handling on rough surfaces, fewer flats)

Road {{{2
	brakes travel small distance so not suitable for wide tires or fenders
	convert to cyclo-cross by installing center pull brakes and wider tires

Comfort {{{2
	wide seats, suspension, easy to mount
	Crank Forward
		- place two feet down easily
		- little adjustment needed for rider size
		- relaxed handling good for new cyclists
