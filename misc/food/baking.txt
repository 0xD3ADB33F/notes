NOTES : Spelt, an ancient grain, makes an exceptional bread flour.
Spelt bread rises well without the addition of gluten and has a soft
and fine-grain texture.  Substitute spelt flour for whole wheat flour
in any recipe.  Replace each cup of whole wheat flour with 1 cup plus
1 tablespoon of spelt flour.
