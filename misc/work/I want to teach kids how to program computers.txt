I want to teach kids how to program computers 

Courses at TDSB are too product driven.

Real motivation comes from problem solving - good tools let the hacker express their interest directly

Programming like this is an extension of creativity and a desire to create the solution that most closely satisfies the requirements of the situation.


collaborative decision-making and reciprocal learning
acknowledge students as responsible individuals
