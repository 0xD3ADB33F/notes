HOWTO's at cdrecord website

Config
   kernel 2.6
        cdrecord <filename.iso>
        Uses device as specified in /etc/cdrecord/cdrecord
        Defaults to 'cdrom'

		find device
			grep hd /var/log/kern.log e.g dev=/dev/hdc
            or
            cdrecord dev=ATAPI -scanbus
		old
			USB: works as for kernel 2.4
			ATA
				recent versions no longer need ide-scsi.  Can now use DMA to write CD's
				on ATAPI devices - module ide-cd
				find device names (from doc README.ATAPI.setup)
					cdrecord dev=ATAPI -scanbus 
					add to /etc/cdrecord/default
					  CDR_DEVICE=cdrw
					  cdrw=ATAPI:3,0,0     12       30m
				   Insert the right values, the fields are described in the manpage
				   of cdrecord. Alternatively, you may use this values as
				   cdrecord-parameter or take a frontend with an own configuration
				   scheme, then you don't need to modify /etc/default/cdrecord.
				   The columns must be separated by tabs.

					can use: dev=/dev/hdc ?
				for non-root
					doesn't show some devices - DVD writer?
					cdrecord -scanbus dev=ATA 
					dev=ATA:x,y.z 


Utilities
---------

current 9/06 Debian utils:
	wodim - front end to cdrkit utils
	cdrkit is fork of cdrtools
	cdrtools = cdrecord/mkisofs/cdda2wav

wodim - write iso's
cdrecord - package is now just a link to wodim
mkisofs - create iso's
growisofs - writing to a CD/DVD
dvdrip - copy & squish onto a VCD or SVCD
readcd (part of cdrecord package)
    run with dev spec and no options to get speed info
isodump, isoinfo, & isovfy utilities on knoppix

Procedures
---------
copy your cd into an image file:
    dd if=/dev/cdrom of=RedHat60.img
verify copied image
    Method 1: compare sums:
        sum -r /dev/cdrom
        sum -r RedHat60.img
    Method 2: compare checksums:
        cksum /dev/cdrom
        cksum RedHat60.img
    Method 3: compare contents manually
        mount /mnt/cdrom
        mkdir /tmp/RH60CD
        mount -t iso9660 RedHat60.img /tmp/RH60CD -o loop
        diff -r /tmp/RH60CD /mnt/cdrom
        Broken links indicated with 'target not found'

make a permanent mount point for an image on disk
    iso.img /home/ftp/pub/distro/i386 iso9660 defaults,loop,ro   0 0

Make a new image from disk contents
    cd_dir will be root of CD   
    mkisofs options -o filename.iso cd_dir [cd_dir]     or
    mkisofs options cd_dir > filename.iso

    options
        -R  use RockRidge extentions -r  as above, but modify permissions to 
            make globally readable and owned by root
        -f follow symbolic links in src
        -graph-points - graft paths at points other than at root directory
            foo/bar=../file
            foo/bar=/a/dir/somewhere
        -M <path>   Merge to an existing iso file
        -M <SCSI device> Merge to cdrom (see man page)
        -o <file>   Output file name
        -path-list <file>   list of paths to include
        -x path  - exclude path (can use globbing)

Remaster/alter an iso
    mount -o loop -t iso9660 iso dir
    cp -a dir/* someotherdir
    <do something>
    mkisofs -pad -l -r -J -v -V "gnoppix" -b CREDATIV/boot.img -c CREDATIV/boot.cat -hide-rr-moved -o gnoppix-0.5.4-1-en.iso /somewhere_else
    for knoppix english version use
        -b KNOPPIX/boot-en-img


DVDs
        utils
                regionselect
    regionset - view and modify the region code of DVD drives
    Regionset is a small utility which displays and sets the
    region/zone setting of a DVD drive, allowing it to decrypt the
    DVD's sold in this geographical zone. Hardware vendors often limit
    the number of such modifications, but it is necessary to set it at
    least once with a brand new drive.
