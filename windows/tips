Explorer Switches
	Explorer switches are useful in creating rooted folders:
		Explorer [/e][,/root,<object>][[,/select],<sub object>]	

	/e	Use Explorer view (scope and results pane view).  The default is Open view (results pane view only).	
	/root<object>	Specify the object in the "normal" namespace that will be used as the root (top level) of this Explorer/Folder (ie., local path or UNC name).  The default is to just use the normal namespace root (the Desktop).	
	/Select	The parent folder is opened and the specified object is selected.	
	<sub object>	Specify the folder to get the initial focus unless /select is used. The default is the root.	
	Examples:	'Explorer /e, /root, \\pyrex' will open an Explorer rooted at \\pyrex.	
	l'Explorer /select, c:\windows\calc.exe' will open a folder scoped to c:\windows (or activate one that is currently open) and select calc.exe.	

	'Explorer /e, /root, \\source\internal\design\users\David\Archive' will open a folder scoped and rooted to the Archive folder above. This is a nice way to create a dedicated, remote, documents' archive directory. A link to this folder (\\source\internal\design\ users\David\Archive) can then be placed in the sendto folder for quick routing of documents.	

Opening Additional Windows In Single Window Browse Mode
	If your View Options are set to Browse Folders Using a Single Window for
	Each Folder,  you can open  an additional window for the folder by holding
	Ctrl while you double click.

Suppressing Startup Shortcuts
	Hold down the CTRL key while entering Windows.  This will keep items in the Startup folder from launching.

Toggling Between a Windowed and a Full MS-DOS Screen
	Press Alt+Enter.

Visual Display of Directory from Command Prompt
	If you are at a command prompt, and want a visual display of a directory,
	just type "start .", or "start .." and an open folder pointing to that
	directory will start on the desktop.

Entering '.' in Run dialog displays Desktop.


Improved Keyboard Access By Using Accelerator Keys
	You can improve keyboard access to the Start menu or Programs menu on the
	Start button by placing an ampersand ("&") before a unique letter in the
	name of items (rename them with an ampersand within the name = e.g.,
	"&MS-DOS Prompt" will allow the user to type ctrl-esc-p-m to quickly launch
	a command prompt using the keyboard).  Then, you can press Ctrl-Esc
	followed by a p (for Programs) and the accelerator key letter to quickly
	launch an item.
