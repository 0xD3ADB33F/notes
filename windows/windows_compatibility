CrossOver Office
----------------

    I saw that you're looking for volunteers with WindowsXP experience for your computer lab.  I'm sorry that I can't help you out since I'm already volunteering with a computer program at St. Christopher House but I do have a comment regarding WindowsXP - just in case you haven't yet purchased or installed it or you're considering buying new licenses.

    Are you aware that an add-on product for Linux allows you to run all versions of MS Office in a very Windows compatible environment  - especially when you have more than one computer - without needing to pay for WindowsXP?  The add-on is called Crossover Office - I think it costs $70US or so and can be added onto any version of Linux.  I've tried it with 'Xandros' Linux, a Canadian and very Windows-compatible Linux.  Crossover easy to install and runs Office apps just about as fast as they do under Windows.  You do still need a Office CD & license to do the installation.

    Also - as with pretty much all commercial Linux software, once you buy a product, you can install it on as many machines as you want, so you pay for a product only once.

    Hope this is helpful to you.
