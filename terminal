Serial Terminal Connection
--------------------------

Send commands via a serial cable:

	..if your screen is FUBAR, plug a serial cable from it to another 
 box, and append "serial /dev/ttyS0" or somesuch to the boot command,
 'man syslinux' for details, swap "syslinux" for your own distro's 
 install bootloader.  On your other box, read output and write 
 commands to its own end of the cable, should work pretty much 
 like a ssh session or "DOS Window" session.

	See grub manual for grub over serial line

re: laptop with no video -
So...I ran a getty on /dev/ttyS0, and am using minicom to access a
serial terminal.

  - minicom -s /dev/ttyS0
  - disable modem init and reset strings
  - upping baud rate to 57600 (on both sides of the connection) speeds
    response considerably over the 9600 default.

re: file transfer - 
Why not run a laplink cable and run pppd at both ends? (remember to
specify "local" to pppd).  Or even plip?
