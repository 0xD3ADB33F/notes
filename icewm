Desktop Icons 
    not done by WM but by file managers (from Icewm FAQ):
        Sure, but not from IceWM. Again, this is desktop environment work, but
        usually done by the respective file managers, since they already know
        about MIME types, file endings and such. IceWM users usually use idesk,
        dfm, roxm kfm or gmc, where idesk, dfm and rox are better suited for
        work on smaller (older) machines than the other two.
