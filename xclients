Geometry specification in X
	WIDTHxHEIGHT{+-}<xoffset>{+-}<yoffset> (ie size & location)
	Size is specified in characters or pixels depending on application.
	Location is specified in pixels.
	Both are measurements from an edge of the screen to the corresponding edge 
	of the window.

xclients
	Handles configuration according to which wm is being run.

remote clients
	quote: In my experience, running remote applications over compressed ssh is much faster than using a tcp port (and safer) and cpu utilization is very low.

Running from command line
	Can start with a command (-e option) which shows as window title.
	When program exited from, window closes.
	-t specify other title

	example: rxvt -geometry 50x20+600+300 -bg grey -fg black -e lynx &

Creating application class defaults using Xresources
	config file: ~.Xdefaults.  Override defaults with command line directives
	Determine a window name and class
		xprop | grep WM_CLASS
	then apply resource properties as 
	name[.*]Class.prop: value
	or?
	resource_name[.*]Class.window_name.prop: value

	'name.class' - how resource is referenced externally? eg by icewm menus?

	To set sizes of individual windows: set the following X resources

		Netscape*Navigator.geometry: WxH+X+Y      for the browser windows
		Netscape*Mail.geometry: WxH+X+Y           for the mail window
		Netscape*News.geometry: WxH+X+Y           for the news window
		Netscape*Bookmark.geometry: WxH+X+Y       for the bookmark window
		Netscape*AddressBook.geometry: WxH+X+Y    for the addressbook window
		Netscape*Composition.geometry: WxH+X+Y    for the composition window

		Netscape*TopLevelShell.geometry: WxH+X+Y  sets all of the above windows
		to be the same size.
		The -geometry command line option sets the sizes of just the
browser, mail and news windows.

Then use /usr/bin/X11/xrdb -load ~/.Xdefaults to load them without logging out.


Set xterm config
	xtermset:
		-T title, -n icon name etc.
	
Show Window Information 
	xwininfo
	xprop - extended info
		WM_CLASS - returns "name" "class"
Show fonts
	xfontsel
	xrdb - X Resources Manager:
        xrdb -merge | -load $HOME/.Xdefaults

title script in /usr/local/bin:
	#!/bin/bash
	echo -ne "\033]0;$1\007"

Xterm with Command
	-geometry 70x40+0+5 -T 'Python Docs' -e lynx pydocdir
	'-e' must be last argument
	
X apps options
	-xrm "*Desk:1"	specify resource string (run on Desk 1)
	XTerm*Desk: 1	same thing in .Xdefaults file
	-T, --title	window title	
	-bg		window background
	-bd		window border color
	-bg/fg	background/forground (text?) color
	-fn		font (defult fixed)
	-geometry	Size & position of window
	-geometry Width x Height +/-Xoff +/-Yoff
		+X offset is n from screen left edge
		-X offset is n from right
		+Y offset is n down from bottom edge
		-Y offset is n up
	-iconic		start as icon
	-name		application name under which resources to be obtainedda
	+sb		No scrollbar
	-e	command to run (must be last arg)
        [prog args]	run program

Xterm start args
	-ls	make login shell
	-sl #	number of lines to save in buffer
	See man xterm and man X for more info.


X Character Sets (from XFree README.fonts)
	A coded character set is a set of characters together with a mapping from 
	integer codes - known as codepoints - to characters (e.g. US-ASCII, ISO 
	8859-1).
	A coded character set need not use 8-bit integer to index characters - 16 
	bit or more sets are needed for ideographic writing systems.
