Tip:
Find directory size
    du -h | tail -1

cp
	-a      Archive (dpR) - Don't follow sym links, preserve file attributes,
			copy recursively.
	-b      backup replaced files (append ~)
	-i      Interactive - prompt before replacing
	-r      Recurse (copy sub-dirs)
	-u      Update - only replace older files

Gzip, gunzip	
		Compresses files, saves to fn.gz, removes original
		-a	Leave file compressed, write contents to so.

Tar	
	tar [functions & options] [target filename or device] [filesname(s)]	

	Default archive location is /dev/sa0 (tape drive) - so usually specify
	location with f <fn>

	By default extracts archives into directories relative to the
	extraction directory, not relative to file system root.

	functions:
	c	new		u	update
	x	extract		r	append
	t	list		d 	compare to fs
	C	change to dir before action

	options:
	v	verbose
	z	use gzip/gunzip
	f [fn]	file name
	M	Create archive on multiple volumes (use with c)	
	
	List archive contents: tvzf fn   
	Extract all files: xvzf fn

	Follow these with path & name of file to view/extract
	tar tzvf [fn]	show contents

	Examples:

	Create archive of current dir
	tar cf backup.tar .

	List archive
	tar tf backup.tar

	Create an archive of /d1 and /d2 and store in /d3
	tar cvf /d3 /d1 /d2

	Make a compressed archive of std in (from find) and redirect to f1
	tar czvf - `find . -print` > f1.tar

	Extract a file from an archive:
	tar -x '*outlook.pst' -zf /g/Backups/AndrewBackup.tgz

	Exclude a directory (exclude can be a file or literal text) (can reverse order of options: fX archive exclude)
	tar cXf exclude backup.tar dir

	Make exclude file:
	echo excludestring > exclude
	echo nextstring >> exclude

	Tar Notes:

	No point compressing an archive that will be encrypted with gpg -e.

	Can use 'M' switch for backup to multi-volume floppies, zip etc just in case doesn't fit.  Don't mount device first, and to check the archive, list without mounting (actually - won't be able to mount - will give 'incorrect superblock' error)
