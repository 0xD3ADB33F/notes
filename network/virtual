Macvlan {{{1

Networking switches in domain0 on virtualization hosts use
this feature to support seperate MACs per guest node,
and if the chip doesn't support this the chip is put into
promiscuous mode.


Tun/tap {{{1

User-mode pseudo Ethernet or Point to Point device

Program creating devices must open /dev/net/tun
Device created with be either tunxx or tapxx
Tun devices r/w IP packets
Tap devices r/w Ethernet frames

Common use: data written to tap then tunneled to an end point and written to another tap

Need tunctl from uml utilities package

From http://uml.nagafix.co.uk/

tunctl -t tap1
ifconfig tap1 192.168.0.1
dhcpd tap1

The dhcp configuration file (generally stored in /etc/dhcpd.conf) would look like this:

default-lease-time 6000;
max-lease-time 72000;
option domain-name-servers 192.168.0.1;
option routers 192.168.0.1;
server-name "192.168.0.1"
ddns-update-style none;
subnet  192.168.0.0  netmask  255.255.255.0  {
 range 192.168.0.100 192.168.0.254;
 }

 Note: you may have to use your DNS IP for the domain-name-servers (which you can grab from the host's /etc/resolv.conf) if the host does not have its own DNS.
 Next you need to allow the host to forward packets to and from the guest:


 echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
 iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
 iptables -I FORWARD -i tap1 -j ACCEPT
 iptables -I FORWARD -o tap1 -j ACCEPT
