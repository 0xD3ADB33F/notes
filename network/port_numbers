n the past few years, port assignments on UNIX-based operating systems have changed from their original locations. Here is a list of current Red Hat-based Linux port assignments:

# Ports 0-1,023: The Well-Known or Reserved ports are standardized and
controlled by IANA, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. These ports are
generally used for standard incoming system and protocol interactions.

# Ports 1,024-49,151: The Registered ports are also used for incoming services,
but are not regulated as strictly as the first 1,024 ports (remember, under
UNIX, 0 counts as a number). These ports are controlled by community standards,
not by dictated rules.

# Ports 32,768-61,000: These Ephemeral or Dynamic port assignments are specific
to the Linux 2.4 kernel, but can very by distro. They are used by outgoing
client requests and programs to establish connections with other servers. On
some systems, Ephemeral ports range up to 65,535. You can see this kernel
setting on your Linux 2.4 kernel by looking at the kernel's proc filesystem


    # cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range
    32768 61000
