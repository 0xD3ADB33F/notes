As Chuck Mead already pointed out, if you're running portmap and don't
need it, turn it off.  However, I have another question. Is this
portsentry installed via rpm? If so, did you modify the configuration?
The default config included in the redhat rpm doesn't listen on port 111.
When you start portsentry, it outputs info as it binds to all the ports.
You should see log messages similar to:
Sep 19 00:01:02 roswell portsentry[14009]: adminalert: Going into listen
mode on TCP port: 111
In your case, do you see an attempt to bind to port 111? If it can't bind
to a port , that should be reflected in the log as well.

If you're looking for an rpm for portsentry, look at ftp.redhat.com.
It's in /pub/redhat/linux/7.1/en/powertools/i386/RedHat/RPMS/
portsentry-1.0-11.i386.rpm         src.rpm on my machine into a

Also, I've built an rpm from the portsentry 1.1 source. It's here:

http://www.tuxfan.homeip.net/rpms/portsentry-1.1-0.src.rpm

The default config doesn't listen on port 139 either.  However, unless
you need it, you should probably block port 139 from the internet via
your firewall.

Bill - If you are seeing it on Firestarter's hit list monitor then it is being
+blocked since Firestarter logs and drops packets by default. If anything gets
+through, you won't see it.

It will listen to all ports below 1023 that do not have daemons
listening, except...
There should also be a define in the config file for ports to ignore in
advanced stealth mode. That is probably why your not seeing portsentry
bind to port 111. From the config file:
