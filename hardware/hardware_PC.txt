*	Locate active partition on 1st hd.  Local partition boot sector may
	either load OS or load a boot loader program (eg NTLDR)

*	Use info from any partition + use that to load an OS on any partition
*	(eg Lilo, O/S2)



Storage

Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) - method by which most hard drives, internal CD-ROM drives, and other internal storage devices are connected to computers.  

UDMA and Ultra ATA are current IDE standards.  UDMA is a controller (ie motherboard) standard while Ultra ATA (or Ultra IDE) refers to drives.  Current Ultra speed is 33 MB/sec. (vs. 80 MB/sec for Ultra Wide SCSI 2)  Next generation IDE Ultra standard will run at 66 MB/sec.
