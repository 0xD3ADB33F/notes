	A quote:
		: The Barton XP2500 is really cheap these days and still very fast, and
		AFAIK, totally unlocked. Combined with a top nForce2-based mobo, I
		reckeon this represent a top value in good performance quiet
		computing." The Barton's have a bigger cache than the others (512K) and
		cache is good because it doesn't increase heat much. (11/03)

Fan/HeatSink
	your best option is any heatsink designed to be used with an 80mm fan where
	the fan is easily replacable (not built into the heatsink) that way if it's
	still not quiet enough you can try any number of quiet 80mm fans until you
	find one you like without having to buy another heatsink.

		Gigabyte GA-7VT600 
			good features, decent price ($100 cdn), speed ok, good overclocking

		MSI KT6 Delta (MS-6590) 
			even better features, somewhat pricier
			'LSR' model more common - $112 cdn

HardDrives
	Samsung Spinpoint

		recommended as quiet - 11/03
		SP1614N also recommended as quiet/fast
	Older
		http://www.hardwareanalysis.com/content/article/1540.1/ - 10/02
		Seagate's ST380020A and ST380021A, better known as the Barracuda IV -
		lowest noise.
		Western Digitals 400AB and 800AB, both 5400-rpm harddisks showed
		exceptional performance on par with all but the fastest 7200-rpm
		harddisks. If youre looking for an affordable, high-performance and yet
		silent 5400-rpm harddisk either of these will fit your needs exactly.

		Quote:
		Actually I'd say the Maxtor Diamondmax Plus 8 and 9 are the quietest
		drives out there. The Barracuda ATA drives don't seem to me to be any
		quieter than the WDs, not that either of them are loud to begin with...
		but the Maxtor you can't even hear run. If you want the quietest
		possible drive, it would have to be the Diamondmax Plus 8, which is a
		slim formfactor 7200RPM ATA133 drive. I think the maximum size is 40GB.
		The 60s and 80s and above are not the same design.

SCANNERS
	Epson
		Perfection 610
			Price comparable to SnapSnans, said by CNET to have better image

			Highly rated by users on ComputingReview (good image quality, solid
			construction)
		Perfection 640U
			$212 on 'MyITSource'
		1240U
			1200x2400 dbpi resolution
			$216 on 'MyITSource'
			Pros: Fast, graphics emphasis
	Afga
		SnapScan 1212 series and Touch
			Probably same hardware.
			Generally rated best (not as slow and very good image) for greyscale
		SnapScan E series
			newer models 
				E20 $99 'MyItSource'
				E40 and above - higher resolutions
				E40 $190 'MyITSource'
		CNET on SnapScan:
			According to Agfa, Photo-mat (which we used for speed and quality
			testing) minimizes the interference pattern generated by the
			dimpling on a matte-finish photo. When using the Photo-glossy
			setting, scanning times were about three times faster than when
			using Photo-mat, but the resulting output suffered for it. 

Cases
    ZDNet: Antec cases, e.g. low cost Antec KS-282
    Antec Sonata recommended for quiet
    Case Buying Tips:
        Power Supply - at least 300w, ATX 2.01 compliant.
		If a case fan is needed, place at the back drawing air over the
		processor and out the back of the case.
		Also, after installing, keep cables away from processor so as to not
		block air flow.

   

Power Supplies
-----------------

From TomsHardware 11/02 Survey:
http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/02q4/021021/index.html

With its generous maximum output of 390 watts (at which point it powers down in an orderly fashion), the Verax FSP300-60ATV is an impressive performer. Thanks to its quiet fan, the Verax is practically inaudible in use. Also recommended is the Fortron FSP. This model achieved a maximum output of 450 watts - and it was quiet. The Herolchi HEC-300LR-PT was one of the least expensive units in our test. Despite its low price of about $50, this 300-watt power supply performed well. It also addressed safety issues adequately with a built-in safety cutout. 

For those looking for a more readily available solution, we recommend the Antec True Power 380P. Antec has done a good job in making their products available from a variety of sources including many local retailers. Chances are that you will have no problems being able to find the Ture Power 380P. The True Power 380P offers a good balance of performance for the money, but expect to pay a little more for this unit, but you will get excellent packaging and a manual that is ahead of the others.
