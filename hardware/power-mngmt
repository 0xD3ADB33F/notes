from cpufreq list
	 p4-clockmod is not SpeedStep.  Normal.  As Dominik say, p4-clockmod
	is *not* intended for power comsuption issues.

	There is normally two reasons for slowing a CPU:

	1- change voltage of processor (SpeedStep, Powernow, etc.)
	   The usage for is to get more battery life, or to get less power comsuption
	   for the system.

	2- throttling the CPU via clock modulation (P4 only), or by generating
	   a signal which toggle the STP# pin of a CPU.  The usage for it is
	   to cool the CPU instead of turning on/off the CPU fan.  It is also
	   used if the fan is not sufficiant to cool enough the CPU.

	1 and 2 do not have the same goal.  The CPUFreq project currently only
	handle case 1- (via policy, governor, etc.).  But I'm thinking about
	designing case 2- for the cpufreq core (there is already something for,
	but it is not exactly what I would expect), and that should rely on
	lm-sensors or/and ACPI thermal.

S2k Bus Disconnect in Athlon XP processors
	http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/cpu/display/athlonxp-3000.html
	chipset support for S2k
		VIA KT400, VIA KM400, SiS 746 and NVIDIA nForce2
	mbs with BIOS control
	Abit 
		NF7-S v1.4
		NF7-S v2.0 (nforce2)
	ASUS 
	 	A7V8X v1.04 
	EPoX

ACPI 1.1b & 2.0 Processor Performance States
	bus disconnect requested by processor, done by system controller (Northbridge)
	C0 - working - bus connected
	C1 - Halt - bus disconnected
	C2-  Stop Grant - bus disconnected

	Southbridge can force a Stop Grant in response to high temperature
	OS can request a Stop Grant via the Southbridge if a Thermal Zone is defined
	OS can also do this if initiating a S1 (Powered On Suspend) sleep state


Energy Star/ DPMS control
	xset dpms standby, suspend, off


CPUFreq API based projects
	under power management but not under ACPI in 2.6 kernel config
	cpu support mostly mobile processors:
		AMD only with PowerNow
	recommended power schemes
		P4
			p4-clockmod -older
			speedstep-ich/speedstep Centrino or acpi recommended
	cpudyn project
		kernel
			2.4 with patch, included in -ac branch
			2.6 
				just select driver
				performance governor + powersave 
				check /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq
		config
			two power states: powersave & performance
			set wto max/min with 
				killall -USR1/-USR2 cpudynd
			monitor
				cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
				cat /proc/cpuinfo 
					shows adjusted cpu speed?
					doesn't seem to be accurate
	cpufreqd
		vs. cpufreqd
			doesn't spin down disks
		support for sysfs?

Post-cpufreq support in 2.6
	enable powersaving via userspace program option in kernel
	as of 7/04, no desktop mb's support this
