Madison Kelly on TLUG list on newly installed mb not POSTing:

	What happens if you unplug everything non-essential and try to POST? Ie: unplug all drives, use on-board video if it has it, and such? Will it POST then? If not, try putting the RAM in a different DIMM slot. If you have any parts around, try different RAM or a different video card if you don't have on-board video.

	If you can get it to POST with minimal parts then it's just a matter of putting parts back until it dies again and you have your answer. If you just can't get it to POST, does the PSU fan spin up? If not, and if you are careful, unplug the PSU from everything except something like an old CD-ROM or disk drive (switched PSUs need a load to power up) and then short pin 13 to ground.

	Pin 13 on the main PSU power cable (the 20 or 24pin mainboard plug) is usually the only green one and is usually a slightly smaller gauge then the rest. Any black wire is ground. If the PSU is okay and the load is sufficient the PSU should power on and you'll head the fan spin. If it still doesn't you probably have a toasted PSU. Obviously you do this test at your own risk! :p

	If you have another system that you can try the RAM in see if it works there. If so, then you probably have a bad mobo or CPU but either way it sounds like it came as one unit so it should be easy to get an RMA (replacement) for it.
