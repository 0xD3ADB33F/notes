    11/05 - new CUPS tutorial
        http://www.linuxprinting.org/tutorial.html

Architecture
    Standard printer languages: PostScript, ESC/P and HP PCL (but not HP PPA)
    - PostScript
        Probably once used by high end printers
        Now is output by apps then converted by a filter like Ghostscript
        to native formats like PCL

    Host-based/GDI printers/HP PPA printers
        - not supported by print servers
    - PPA
        closed HP protocol moves low level processing from printer to PC
        Allows low cost printers & flexible drivers


Host-based (sometimes referred to as GDI printers). A printer that relies on
the computer's processor to rasterize the print job. Most host-based printers
use the GDI interface built into Windows (hence the "GDI printer" term), so
there is no need to convert the data to PostScript, PCL, or other printer
language. Some HP Deskjet printers are PPA (Printing Performance Architecture)
printers. With this new printing system, the printer handles only basic printer
functions while the printer software on the computer handles the formatting.
All formatting, such as color matching and correction, half-toning, edge
enhancement, tone correction, and ink management, are handled by the software
driver.

Shorewall Firewall settings needed for printer discover & printing
	IPP/ACCEPT $FW net
	SNMP/ACCEPT $FW net             #tcp,upd destination ports 161,162, for hp-leve>
	Jetdirect/ACCEPT    $FW     net # 9100 tcp,udp
	SLP discovery:
		ACCEPT      $FW     net udp 427 
		ACCEPT      net     $FW udp -   427 
	mDNS discovery
		ACCEPT      $FW     net udp 5353 
		ACCEPT      net     $FW udp -   5353 

Network probe
    UDP: sudo nmap -sU '192.168.1.103'
    TCP: nmap -A '192.168.1.103'
	Test mDNS with avahi-discover

    TCP 9100 - printing aka TCP/Socket, AppSocket, JetDirect
    TCP 80 - web interface
    TCP 139 - net bios / SMB

    UDP 161 SNMP - configure & query JetDirect status
    UDP 1900 uPnP

TCP/Socket
	socket://<printer IP>:<port number>

LPD - former standard UNIX printing protocol
	port 515
	lpd://<printer-ip>/<queue-name>

SMB
	port 139
	lpd://<printer-ip>/<queue-name>



Old printing protocols
	515	printing via LPD
	631	printing via IPP

HP AIO
    HPOJ 
        - no longer developed
        - doesn't support newer models
    HPIJS
        - good for print-only operatation
    HPLIP
        - provides AIO features
        - includes HPIJS
        - includes SANE backend hpaio

    Debian packages
        hplip 
        hplib-ppds
        foomatic-db-hpijs driver
        foomatic-filters-ppds
        hpijs

        
    Add & Config
        add USB printer in CUPS: device =
            hp:/usb/<printer name>?serial=<s/n>
        need cups backend entry 'hp://

    Utils
        start with 'hp_'

Troubleshooting

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingPrintingProblems

	test connection to USB printer
		echo "Thing" > /dev/usb/lp0
		debian: /dev/.static/dev/usb/lp0

	no output
		said may be due to old or missing PPD


Printer definitions
	PPD - Postscript Printer Def 
		not necessarily for Postscript printers
		Cross platform standard format
		found at /usr/share/postscript/ppd
		installed printer PPD's at /etc/cups/ppd

Debian
	Packages cupsys, cupsys-bsd
	configure with url localhost:631
	djtools
		HP DeskJet utilites
	
OpenOffice
	set up with oopadmin utility

Utils
	.tex file => latex => .dvi file
	.dvi file => xdvi for viewing
	.dvi file => dvips -o target_fn.ps source_fn - for conversion to ps or 
	direct from dvips to lpr
	.ps file => gs for viewing

Lynx includes an HTML to plain text converter.


Particular hardware
	HP All-in-one USB
		HP sponsored hpoj (Debian package name) project provides support
