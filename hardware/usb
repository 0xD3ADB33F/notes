docs
	USB Flash & Sysfs under kernel 2.6 howto
		http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/Flash-Memory-HOWTO

standards
	"USB 2.0 High Speed" certification
		"USB 2.0 Full Speed" = USB 1.1
    How to tell:
        cat /proc/bus/usb/devices 
        Spd=12 means USB 1.1 or maybe 1.0
        Spd=480 means USB 2.0


Kernel compile
	hotplug recommends compiling in host controller, keyboard & mouse modules to avoid risk of boot errors

Host Controller Drivers
		uhci-hcd for UHCI controllers (most Intel & Via boards).
			now only one driver
			name is usb-uhci on Fedora
		ehci-hcd for EHCI (USB 2.0) controllers
            also requires uhci-hcd
		ohci-hcd for OHCI controllers (rare)
		usbfs
			need to mount
				mount -t usbfs none /proc/bus/usb
HID devices
	Mice, keyboards, joysticks, graphics tablets
	kernel 2.6 config
		need both:
			USB_HID - full HID support
			module hid or compile in
			USB_HIDINPUT - input layer support
				also need for this CONFIG_INPUT input device support
				seems no module option - compile in
		
Mass Storage devices
	incl. USB CD-ROM's, HD's, maybe cameras & card readers
	k2.6 
		module usb-storage
		USB-storage has changed behaviour. A device which is disconnected and then reconnected is not reassociated with the old /dev node.
		config
			SCSI device/SCSI support, SCSI device/SCSI generic, SCSI emulation
			kernel boot param: hdx=ide-scsi
	BIOS setting to boot usb flash drives: s/b USB-HDD (per syslinux docs)


Misc Options
	USB_DEVICEFS - USB device filesystem
		also enable /proc support - usbfs under /proc/bus/usb
