Drivice Driver Modules
    All hardware identified by device files.  3 types:
        Character - can handle data one character at a time, e.g. modems
        Block - can handle larger amounts - blocks - at a time e.g. disk drives
        Network - data sent in packets
            File listing in /dev identifies type in left column
	- Drivers allow kernel to pass data to and from the device
	- Kernel modules can be inserted into runing kernel and removed if unneeded.
	utils
		lsmod		List loaded modules
		insmod		Load module
		rmmod		Unload module

kernel & udev can load 'detectable' modules (on USB & PCI buses)
    see hotplug docs for more on how to tell if a module is detectable
    character, block, & network protocol drivers mostly loaded on use

Still must be loaded in /etc/modules and /etc/modprobe.d/ (as of summer 05)
    ide-cd
    sound modules (in modprobe.d)


modprobe and module-init-tools as of 6/04
	modprobe.conf no longer used
	module loading statements in /etc/modprobe.d/

** OLD **
module config as done by update-modules
	under kernel 2.6
		provided by module-init-tools package.  Old modutils utilities renamed as
		*.modutils and are still used under a 2.4 kernel
		manual entries in /etc/modprobe.conf - run update-modules
		/etc/modprobe.conf includes /lib/modules/modprobe.conf which is generated
		from the contents of /etc/modprobe.d/	
	files
		under kernel 2.4
			/etc/modules.conf 
		/etc/conf.modules - obsolete
		/etc/modules
			Debian: names of kernel modules to load at boot
	modules aliases in modprobe.conf/modules.conf
		alias device_file  common_name
		Debian: generated from list of modules in /etc/modules by update-modles	
** OLD **	

Hardware Monitor & Conifg
	View interrups use
		cat /proc/interrupts
	View i/o port addresses
		cat /proc/ioports
	List contents of virtual device space
		ls /proc
	List devices on pci bus including pc cards
	 	cat /proc/pci
	List processes using a file or filesystem
		fuser
	Resources not in use are not listed.

Permissions
	fstab entry 
		allows user access to a device (make user member of usb group)
			/dev/cf_card /mnt/flash/cf vfat  defaults,noexec,rw,user,uid=0,gid=432,umask=007,noauto 0 0
		explanation
			Noexec prevents programs from being run from the card, rw is
			read/writable, user allows users to mount it, uid=0 means all files are
			owned by user 0 (root), gid=432 means the files are owned by group 432
			(usb), umask=007 means that all files have permissions 770 (which seems
			needlessly cryptic, and took a while to work out), noauto means not to
			try to mount on boot. 


Error messages:
	Error while initializing the sound driver, device /dev/disp can't be opened (Permission denied)
		> Add yourself to the group 'audio' and re-logon.
