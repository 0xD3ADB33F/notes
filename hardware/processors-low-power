			# is GB/second throughput (ie 1.6 GB/second)
		DDR
			Double Data Rate - doubles peak throughput vs. PC133 SDRAM

Power, performance - spring 2008

Via C7 vs Intel D201GLY
	Performance: Intel way better
	Power:
		D201GLY cpu + mb + 3.5" hd = ~25 watts
		for  D201GLY2 &  D201GLY2T 3 watts more
		HP used ~ 6 watts

		C7 + CN400 mb + 3.5" hd = ~20 watts

		Geode LX-800 Alix w/CF card = 5 watts

Intel D201GLY system cost - mini-box.com
	75 board + CPU
	25 512 MB RAM
	50 case
	45 psu

		:set listchars+=precedes:<,extends:>
	model 7 - 900 - 1300? - no ACPI thermal control
	model 8 - 1400-1800 - aka applebred?
		266 max FSB, 1.5 v core (low)
				
	two models of newer duron: 650 & 651 (aka 1600B) (or is it CPUID 680 & 681 ?)
		cores: Morgan (Tbred 'a' - older) vs 'green thoroughbred' (aka 'b' core)
		Durons use Athlon cores with some of L2 cache disabled
		651 is faster & cooler

FSB Ratings

	Memory ratings

	Most of you have good memory, but also, a lot of you have it for bragging rights and don't put it to use. If you have anything above PC2700 speeds, and you DON'T have a Barton 3000+ or 3200+, and you're not overclocking, then your ram is merely an attempted willy-extension that works in reverse to those in the know, and actually halfs the size of your willy. :-)

	Background - CPU FSBs

	Athlon XP Palomino and Thoroughbred CPUs - default FSB 133 (PC2100)
	Athlon XP Barton CPUs - default FSB 166 (PC2700) or 200 (PC3200)

	So, unless you set your ram to run at its rated speed (thus overclocking the FSB of your CPU usually) then you've forked out for summat pointless... here's what FSB you should be running at...

	PC2100 - 133FSB (DDR266)
	PC2700 - 166FSB (DDR333)
	PC3200 - 200FSB (DDR400 for AMD, QDR800 for INTEL)
	PC3500 - 217FSB (DDR433)
	PC3700 - 233FSB (DDR466)
	PC4000 - 250FSB (DDR500)
	PC4200 - 266FSB (DDR533)
