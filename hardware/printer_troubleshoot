Scanner T/S {{{1

sane-find-scanner finds scanner, scanimage -L does not {{{2
sane-find-scanner in scan-utils - USB only

finds the scanner on the NEC. If so, you have a permission problem.

Ubuntu handles scanner permissions via ConsoleKit by setting filesystem
ACLs on the relevant USB devices. Check whether

getfacl /dev/bus/usb/001/003

shows that your user has access to the USB device. Check whether
ck-list-sessions sees your login session. Check whether logging out and
logging in fixes the problem.
