
1. Export Excel worksheet as tab separated text
2. Import into an XML file using Python:

import csv
input = open('datafile', 'rb')
reader = csv.reader(input,dialect="excel-tab")
for line in reader:
    print line




The reader function takes a number of different options. The field separator isn't limited to the comma and can be changed to any character, and so can the quoting and line-ending characters. 

Different dialects of comma-separated files can be defined and registered; currently there are two dialects, both used by Microsoft Excel. A separate csv.writer class will generate comma-separated files from a succession of tuples or lists, quoting strings that contain the delimiter.
