	suggestions
		paste format and/or clear all in paste special
		quick key to change calc value to text
		repeat last action key
		cell reference box at top left - define & select ranges
		insert row in list - should copy formulas, maybe this as an option in Define Range after 'insert and delete cells'
		Ctrl+1 keystroke not in Windows ver
		easy remove filter - 'remove' doesn't remove standard filter
