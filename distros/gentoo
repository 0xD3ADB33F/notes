Setting command options and environment variables Example:

zope command line options can be set in /etc/conf.d/zope with the ZOPE_OPTS variable.

zope environment variables can be set in /etc/env.d/50zope
Before you change anything there...
Code:
/etc/init.d/zope stop
nano /etc/env.d/50zope
env-update
source /etc/profile
