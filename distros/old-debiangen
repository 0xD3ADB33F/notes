Advocacy
	Why Debian
		: Here is an argument for community based as opposed to business model
		: based distributions:
		:
		: Red Hat is abandoning its old business model because that model
		: wasn't working for its investors. You (and everyone else) can expect
		: other distributions that have a business model basis to also fail
		: for the same reasons.  Whatever those reasons are, they were not
		: peculiar to Red Hat.  If you want to avoid going through the
		: transition from one distribution to another, again, you should
		: choose a community based distribution this time.  By doing so, you
		: avoid the inevitable 'churn' in the business marketplace.

			(echo -e "# Knoppix modules\n";\
			awk '{print $1}' /proc/modules >> /mnt/debinst/etc/modules
			Later build kernel with these modules.  Also, copy Knoppix XF86Config-4

		6)  Boot your computer with the ZIP-Disk.
		

Config
	utils
		update-xx   utilities
		configure-debian
			menu of configurable services & packages
		set Locale 
			locales - generate or remove locales
			restore keyboard
				dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low console-data # console		
				dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low xserver-xfree86
			Knoppix:
				edit /etc/sysconfig/i18n to:
				LANG="en_US"
				COUNTRY="US"
				LANG="en_US"
				LANGUAGE="en"
				CHARSET="iso8859-1"
				XMODIFIERS="" 
		rcconf
			control deamons
	modules
		update 1/05: make changes in /etc/modprobe.d/
		Loading modules at boot: 
			(Old?) /etc/modules.conf is control script but is auto-gnerated from data
			files in /etc/modutils and run at boot by script in /etc/init.d/modutils
		update-modules 
			run after updating /etc/modules.conf (2.4) or /etc/modprobe.conf (2.6 but deprecated)
	Hardware detection utilities
		discover -- hardware identification system
        mdetect -- mouse device autodetection tool
        read-edid -- hardware information-gathering tool for VESA PnP monitors
		isapnptools
			detect IO ports of ISA cards, though if card is PnP, look at /proc/isapnp if compiled into kernel
	kernel
		bf2.4 kernel is for installation only - do apt-cache search kernel-image
		and install one for cpu type.
		2.4.20 - must compile with gcc 2.95 - not above
		dmesg to see kernel boot messages about missing modules
	pcmcia
		pcmcia-cs only needed for 16-bit cards - add isa-pnp to /etc/modules?
		if using Cardbus only - kernel 2.4 + hotplug
		install pcmcia-cs after installation
			http://libranet.com/support/view.cgi?version=2.8&item=0375.html
	Power Management
		auto power off when shut down
			in /etc/modules: apm power_off=1
		cpufreq & cpufreqd
			interface with kernel support
			lower cpu & hd power.
			hd spindown even on journaled fs
		cpudyn
			increase cpu speed when needed
		acpid
			don't run at same time as apmd
			need to pass acpi=on to kernel (2.4 kernels only?)
	Networking
		wireless
			Libranet
				install laptop package and wlan drivers
					http://libranet.com/support/view.cgi?version=2.8&item=0302.html
		etherconf (not in Libranet)
			config networking with dpkg-reconfigure etherconf
				- make backup of /etc/hosts
				- If this fails, it is because the kernel doesn't recognize the
				  card modconf - add module for card - adds to /etc/modules
				  rerun dpkg-reconfigure etherconf and 'update-rc.d ethernet
				  defaults'
		iptables
			admin tools for iptables
			run scripts in /etc/networking/interfaces - up, pre-up, down,
			post-down

	Sound
		package sndconfig
		adduser <username> audio (must log out and in to take effect?)
		volumne & mixing: package aumix		
	XFree
		first get hw detection utils above
		xwininfo - info on adapter
		apt-get install (for a reinstall) or dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86
		xvidtune
			adjust screen settings with xvidtune (in xbase-clients)
				will print mode lines.  Paste desired line into a ModeLines 
				section in XF86Config-4 e.g.
					Section "Modes"
						Identifier    "Ulycom"
						ModeLine    "800x600"      49.50    800  832  912 1056
						600  601  604  625 +hsync +vsync
					EndSection
				and make corresponding entry for Monitor section:
					Section "Monitor"
						UseModes "Ulycom"
						Identifier    "Generic Monitor"
						HorizSync    28-50
						VertRefresh    43-75
						Option        "DPMS"
					EndSection

		Other X
			X Server default config - disallows TCP connections in /etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc
		Window Manager
			Change Default WM
					update-alternatives --config x-window-manager
					default_display_manager file in /etc - gdm 'heeds' this settting
					per init.d gdm script
			under Libranet
				When gdm is display manager, Xsession started with command in 
				/etc/gdm/Sessions/Default - default is:
					exec /etc/X11/Xsession /usr/bin/libranet-session
				This references a bunch of possible things: wm as set by 
				Adminmenu or overriden by .libranet/session.conf
			icewm
				investigate icewm-gnome - docs in share/doc
				Can icewm use gnome menus/resource settings as icewm's are too 
				hard to understand and sort of non-standard?


Service Management
	rcconf
    update-rc.d - install & remove Sys-V sytle init links
		said in Debian-User:
			update-rc.d intended for use by package scripts
			manual rm and ln -s of links better for user
				e.g stopping a service
					mv S20foo K80foo_originallyS20
		example
			update-rc.d <service> defaults (2345)
			update-rc.d <service> start 99 2 3 4 5 . stop 99 2 3 4 5 .
			update-rc.d -f remove <service>
		Note remove option will remove all scripts, and so at next upgrade, 
		defaults links will be reinstalled.  Therefore leave stop links in place  
		Look into file-rc
			create a local rc script
			/etc/init.d/skeleton /etc/init.d/local
			vi /etc/init.d/local
			chmod 755 /etc/init.d/local
			update-rc.d local defaults 80
